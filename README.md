# fillit

One of the team project of ecole 42. The objective of this project is to find the smallest square that can contain all of the input tetriminos. We use recursive backtracking to solve this problem. Starting from a very big map, the code will try to put all the pieces into the map. If it can do that, it reduce the map size and try again and again until it fail. Then, print out the last map solution.
